        Hack Club is hiring a Lead Hacker for Hack Club Bank.

        Starting a nonprofit is hard, so we built <Link href="/bank" target="_blank">Hack Club Bank</Link> for our community of 16,000+ teenage programmers. Within 24 hours of joining Bank, organizations get 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, access to a beautiful dashboard for managing their finances, and all financial and legal matters - from tax filings to payroll - handled. 50% of high school hackathons worldwide run on Hack Club Bank, and Elon Musk has tweeted that we're a <Link href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1263275969743216640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"cool group"</Link>.

        Now, Hack Club Bank is expanding beyond just Hack Clubbers. <strong>Over 400 organizations running on Bank have transacted upwards of $4,000,000;</strong> from teenage-run hackathons to <Link href="https://vtdigger.org/2021/04/13/frustrated-with-one-local-newspaper-prominent-charlotte-journalists-help-start-another/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small-town newspapers</Link>.

      <Text as="p">
        With the right leadership, we hope to bring Hack Club Bank to thousands of organizations across the United States and process tens of millions of dollars in transactions. We think do-gooders need the same tools that software engineers do. For them, Bank is like GitHub: transformative. Right now, Bank is the <strong>only part of Hack Club that isn't <Link href="https://github.com/hackclub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</Link>.</strong> In the next year we want to open source it, build an amazing community of Hack Clubbers contributing to it, and onboard 1,000 new organizations through our <Link href="https://givebutter.com/fiscal-sponsorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">partnership with Givebutter</Link>.
