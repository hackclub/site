If you are reading this, you are probably an IT administrator at your organization. **Here's a quick overview of what we need from you.**

Please whitelist or unblock the following domains:

- `*.hackclub.com` - Hack Club's primary domain, hosts workshops, tools and other content
- `hack.af` - link shortener used for miscellanous links
- `*.replit.com`, `*.cdn.replit.com`, and `*.repl.co` - Replit, a browser-based IDE used for workshops
- `*.github.com`, `github.dev` - GitHub, an industry standard for code hosting and collaboration, owned by Microsoft.
- `hackclub.slack.com` - Hack Club's primary communication platform

Feel free to read on for more details and potential alternatives.

## Hack Club Sites

If you are unable to whitelist all subdomains, please whitelist the following:

- `hackclub.com`
- `workshops.hackclub.com`
- `editor.sprig.hackclub.com`
- `sprig.hackclub.com`

## GitHub

Besides the typical HTTP(S) ports, ports 22 and 9418 need to be open for SSH and Git respectively.

## Inspect Element / Developer Tools

Browser developer tools (eg. Inspect Element) are required for web development projects, so that sites can be debugged and styled.

## Replit

Replit provides their own [toolkit](https://docs.replit.com/teams-edu/it-administrators-toolkit) for IT administrators with further options for providing student access to Replit, including a firewalled domain.

Thank you for supporting your students and their interests. If you have any questions, please reach out to us at [clubs@hackclub.com](mailto:clubs@hackclub.com) and we'd be happy to address your concerns.
