If you are reading this, you are probably an IT administrator at your organization. **Here's a quick overview of what we need from you.**

Please whitelist or unblock the following domains:

- `*.hackclub.com` - Hack Club's primary domain, hosts workshops, tools and other content
- `hack.af` and `hack.club` - link shortener used for miscellanous links
- `*.replit.com`, `*.cdn.replit.com`, and `*.repl.co` - Replit, a browser-based IDE used for workshops (Replit is being phased out of Hack Club workshops)
- `*.github.com`, `github.dev` - GitHub, an industry standard for code hosting and collaboration, owned by Microsoft.
- `hackclub.slack.com` - Hack Club's primary communication platform

Feel free to read on for more details and potential alternatives.

## Hack Club Sites

If you are unable to whitelist all subdomains, please whitelist the following:

- `hackclub.com`
- `workshops.hackclub.com`
- `jams.hackclub.com`
- `sprig.hackclub.com`

## GitHub

Besides the typical HTTP(S) ports, ports 22 and 9418 need to be open for SSH and Git respectively.

## Inspect Element / Developer Tools

Browser developer tools (eg. Inspect Element) are required for web development projects, so that sites can be debugged and styled.

## Replit

As of September 2024, Replit has killed educator plans, and may not be financially sustainable for your students. We recommend using our [export tool](https://hackclub.com/replit] to download your previous Repls; and moving to a platform like GitHub Codespaces.

Thank you for supporting your students and their interests. If you have any questions, please reach out to us at [clubs@hackclub.com](mailto:clubs@hackclub.com) and we'd be happy to address your concerns.
