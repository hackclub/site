During his time in Hack Club, he worked on everything from events to engineering. The wildest things from his time at Hack Club include 4am rickshaw rides in New Delhi, attempting to oversee several raves, rickrolling the Slack twice, losing his voice waking up hundreds of sleeping hackers and heartstopping late-night launches. Now at university, Sam will never forget the crazy times at Hack Club and will always have his friends from Hack Club.`}
