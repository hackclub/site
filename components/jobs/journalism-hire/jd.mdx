**Starting salary:** $60-$80k  
**Location:** Burlington, Vermont or remote

Hi I'm Christina Asquith, and I've worked with journalists for 20 years, from top-tier New York Times editors to highly-talented freelance foreign correspondents.

Right now, I'm working with a Silicon Valley-based non-profit, **[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)**, that represents the largest network of teen coders in the world. Our mission is to support a new generation of young people who build, innovate and solve problems with computers. We are a non-partisan, 501(c)(3) non-profit.

We're looking to hire a talented reporter/editor to partner with me to steadily produce highly-reported op-eds, essays and columns on education and technology, which would be published in a variety of different outlets, including print and magazine features; your reporting will also drive events, like Clubhouse conversations, panels and Ask Me Anythings. You should know how to write and pitch to get published; how to produce events; and how to do reporting that gives our ideas gravitas.

You must have a dedicated track record of publishing reported articles, features and op-ed/essays; pitching editors, and turning around copy quickly. You should be a sharp, clear thinker, dogged reporter, and be able to see stories and understand news hooks. Multimedia experience would also be a plus, including simple video editing, social media, and design.

We have a compelling bucket of story ideas that we'd like to execute on.

Here are some must have qualifications:

- The single most important qualification for this job is that you can demonstrate great reporting, including the ability to track down people, get interviews with them, find facts and check them, and fact-check for accuracy
- Minimum 5-10 years experience reporting/writing; a more experienced editor could join on contract
- Published dozens of pieces, some in top tier outlets
- Ability to turn copy around quickly
- Understanding of how to match a piece with an outlet
- Experience producing live events, including setting up events on Clubhouse, panels and Ask Me Anythings - something that shows you can invite guests, come up with newsworthy topics and draft a script of the show
- You have some media contacts

Hack Club is a fun, small, creative, tight-knit team that does a lot of creative, in-person work. We have a strong preference is for someone in-person in Burlington, VT, but we will consider applications from people who want to work remotely, provided they be willing to travel to our offices. We have COVID protocols and take them seriously. Relocation assistance available.

To apply, please email us at journalist.editor@hackclub.com with “hack the planet” in the subject line.

We don’t think we’ll be able to identify this person by looking at resume alone, so please include 300-400 words on your background relative to this role, why you’re interested, and some clips.

Compensation range: $60K – $80k, depending on experience and fit. We offer healthcare and 4 weeks paid vacation.

Hack Club staff works directly with 14-18 year olds, as they run their own clubs and build amazing projects, including a weather balloon that sent an Arduino into space, a summer project that distributed $50k in hardware, a program to send thousands of hand-written cards to front-line COVID workers, a robot from recyled parts in Zambia, and so much more.

Hack Club operates with zero cost to school systems or taxpayers; has no teachers or curriculum; is remote and online; and is totally free and accessible to all teenagers regardless of race, gender or economic background. Our model works in rich, poor, urban and remote schools. Hack Club is also fully transparent with its finances, and operates at one of the lowest costs per student in the nonprofit sector.
