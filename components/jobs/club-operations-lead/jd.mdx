## ABOUT HACK CLUB

Hack Club is a fun, nonprofit tech startup, run by a small team of young, highly-creative engineers, building programs every day for thousands of teenagers from around the world. We support high school coders in starting coding clubs, hackathons, and building awesome projects.

Founded in 2014, Hack Club's mission is to support, inspire and motivate teenagers from all backgrounds to become highly technical and use their computer skills to solve problems. Our goal: to become as ubiquitous, as universal, and as culturally foundational for young people today as the Girl and Boy Scouts were 70 years ago.

Watch our 7 minute documentary on  [The Hacker Zephyr](youtube.com/watch?v=2BID8_pGuqA), a 10-day cross-country coding trip by train, to meet a few of the teens in our community. Growing fast, we currently work with 10,000 to 20,000 teens in 36 states and 22 countries.
