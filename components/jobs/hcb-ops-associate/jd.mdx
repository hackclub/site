_As of June 2021, this position has been filled._

At [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in Shelburne, Vermont, we're building the program we wish we had in high school: a space for [high school hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic).

As part of this, we're seeking to hire a full-time HCB Operations Assistant to report to the [HCB Operations Lead](https://hackclub.com/jobs/hcb-ops-lead/) and join our team of 8 at HQ to support growth of one of our key programs.

**Title:** HCB Operations Associate

**Job Description:**

[HCB](https://medium.com/hackclub/hack-club-bank-is-now-live-for-everyone-including-you-884f7f54836f) is our in-house financial software used by 1,500 Hack Clubbers to financially power their Hack Clubs, hackathons, and student-organized nonprofits. When teenagers use HCB, we act as their backing financial and legal entity, allowing them to leverage our 501(c)(3) nonprofit status to receive donations and use our beautiful in-house software to manage and spend their funds.

Recently, we've made the decision to open up HCB to anyone looking to power their nonprofit. We have nearly 300 various organizations and events that have partnered with HCB within the last 3 years and we're gearing up to grow substantially.

As the first full-time addition to the HCB Operations team, your role will be to partner with the HCB Operations Lead on managing our fiscal sponsorship program. You will assist with onboarding new nonprofits, daily backend operations, and providing world class support. Large or small, each organization partnering with HCB is given exceptional white glove treatment.

You will report to the HCB Operations Lead but will have autonomy over your work day. Each staff member that joins Hack Club is expected to manage their own workload and manage up when they require assistance.

A typical day with HCB may look like this:

- Responding to various HCB user support requests. Users may contact us via email, Slack, texting, and phone calls. How you manage your response time is up to you but we require a 24hr turn-around time frame on weekdays. Requests that come in over the weekend are expected to be responded to on the following Monday.

- Process new applications and set up onboarding calls if appropriate.

- Video calls with HCB users and prospective HCB users.

- Daily backend transaction categorization and management. Money doesn't move in HCB without human approval. Our team is responsible for making sure donations and expenses are mapped to the correct organization.

- Assist with designing new features. We are always looking to add new and exciting features for HCB users and a good portion of our work is assisting with launching these.

- Eventually you would help manage a new partnership that Hack Club is entering into. This would mean that you would be responsible for all fiscally sponsored organizations coming through this partnership and would report to the HCB Operations Lead.

A bit of what we think you'll be like:

- You are extremely relationship and service oriented. You care deeply about providing a world-class experience to those you work with. Perhaps you have a background in hospitality or retail.

- Though you don't need to know how to code for this role, online communities are very important to you. Maybe this means you write fanfiction on AO3, spend hours exploring Breath of the Wild or playing WoW, stay current with world events on r/worldnews, or exchange cosplaying designs on social media.

- You genuinely enjoy solving puzzles. Thinking out of the box comes easily and you are comfortable expressing your solutions to others.

- You're looking forward to working in an environment where you're able to work closely with only a few other people. Everyone has their role to play but we are all interconnected in making sure Hack Club remains an amazing experience for all who join.

- You are encouraging, kind, calm and want to make people's lives better. Maybe you were a middle child always playing the mediator between siblings, the consoling friend in the middle of the night, or the patient math tutor willing to put in the hours to help a student understand.

- You believe in the honor system. You never want to risk your integrity so are always honest and upfront about mistakes or misjudgments.

- You have experience working with either customers, clients, or students. Though you don't need to have management skills, you are used to either setting your own hours / pace or being able to complete a job with little to no supervision.

**Location:** We have an in-person office in Burlington, Vermont where six of us work collaboratively. This is an in-person role, though this position can temporarily (1–2 weeks) start remotely during COVID with relocation assistance provided.

To apply, email us at <jobs@hackclub.com> with "I will go down with this ship" in the subject line. Please include your resume, 300–400 words on your background relative to this role and why you're interested, and a separate 100–200 words on something you're passionate about (a book series, anime, hobby, collecting something, sports, _anything_).

And last, some details on compensation. This role pays between $38K–$43K, depending on your experience—and as a nonprofit we know that's probably less than you'd make elsewhere. We offer healthcare and 4 weeks paid vacation.
