At [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, we're building a giant video game, but instead of being made out of bits and code, it's made out of teenagers. And instead of pushing players to get a high score, Hack Club helps teenagers learn to code, build the most meaningful friendships of their lives, and develop strong identities to become the future leaders our world needs.

Alongside the soccer players, theater kids, and band geeks, we aspire to create and foster a new type of high schooler: the teenage hacker. Our goal: to become as ubiquitous, as universal, and as culturally foundational for young people today as the Girl and Boy Scouts were 70 years ago.

**Title:** Hack Club Bank Operations Lead

**Job Description:**

You'd be our 7th full-time staff member. Your role would be to establish strong relationships with our community members making use of [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/) (1,500 high schoolers).

Bank is a full-stack financial toolkit for organizing hackathons, Hack Clubs, and nonprofits used by hundreds of Hack Club teenagers. Our community can invoice sponsors, issue debit cards for spending, organize transactions, and more. Our clients range from 10 person Hack Clubs with annual budgets of $100 to 1,000 person hackathons with budgets exceeding $100,000.

This is not a normal job. You need to have an interest in software, and you should be inspired by novel new financial mechanisms like crypto. What does the future of finance look like and how can Hack Club Bank play a role? Particularly, where does programming and finance intersect and how can Hack Club Bank further that frontier to the benefit of its community?

As Operations Lead of Hack Club Bank, you'll work closely with clients solving their immediate problems and helping them make maximum use of Bank. You'll also work closely with Hack Club engineering, helping identify and even design new features for Bank.

You will have autonomy in how you make clients happy and how you manage the operations team for maximum impact. A formal list of your responsibilities would be something like:

- Lead our student operations team, have daily communication with them, and organize them for efficient and impactful work. This team has grown Bank from 0 to almost 1,600 users and almost $1 million raised.
- Design our support systems and processes to more quickly and more meaningfully serve Bank users.
- Think ahead and plan and identify process improvements and product improvements that can be implemented through a combination of human and software effort.
- Be the top point of contact for all things Bank.

And a bit of what we suspect you'll be like:

- You love identifying problems, then systematically breaking them down into smaller pieces, so that they can be better solved.
- You have a fascination for software, programming, and crypto that drives you to better make use of these mechanisms to improve people's lives. You like finding out about new technologies and then dream about ways to use them in a productive way.
- You embody the values of a model Hack Clubber: collaborative, kind, high integrity, helpful, and curious
- You have the traits of a patient friend: always encouraging, helping calmly when others might be discouraged, and genuinely wanting to make someone's life a little happier from your interactions
- You have experience organizing others, whether that be in an official role or an unofficial role
- You're excited to work 1:1 with high school students every day

**Location:** We have an in-person office in Burlington, Vermont where four of us work collaboratively. This position can start remotely during COVID with relocation assistance provided.

To apply, email us at bankalanker@hackclub.com with "through the looking glass" in the subject line. We don't think we'll be able to identify this person just by looking at their resume, so please include 300-400 words on your background relative to this role and why you're interested.

And last, some details on compensation. This role pays between $45K - $55K, depending on your experienceâ€”and we know that's probably less than you'd make elsewhere. We offer healthcare and 4 weeks paid vacation.
