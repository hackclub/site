[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports high school coders in starting coding clubs, hackathons, and building awesome projects. Founded in 2014, Hack Club's mission is to support, inspire and motivate teenagers from all backgrounds to become highly-technical, and use their computer skills to solve problems.

Hack Club is a fun, quickly-growing start-up, run by highly-creative engineers, building programs every day for thousands of teenagers from around the world. Formerly headquartered in Silicon Valley, Hack Club recently relocated to Burlington, Vermont area, and employs a growing staff of 12. The right person in this critical role will be excited scale Hack Club to change the lives of thousands of teenagers across America.  

Hack Club advances its mission in 4 ways: teen-led, after-school computer science clubs, an online technical community for teenagers, a fiscal sponsorship program for hackathons and a series of in-person and online technical educational events. 

Currently, Hack Club runs the most active online community for technical teenagers in the country. Our fiscal sponsorshops operates for nearly 400 teen leaders who raised and spent $2m last year. Hack Clubs operate in 22 countries. 

We are governed and advised by a small board of tech founders who are active in building out our donor network. To date, Hack Club's COO has raised $5 million from a dozen committed donors, and the right candidate can leverage our highly-connected network to build a sustainable $5m-$7m a year donor network.  

Hack Club is becoming the 21st century's Boy and Girl Scouts. The right person in this role will change the world. 
 

THE POSITION:
Reporting to the COO, Hack Club's head of philanthropy will be someone who can shape and advance our philanthropy strategy, and lead on executing it in partnership with the founder, COO and board, and a part time team of designers, video and social media contractors. Over time, we would be open to expanding this team as needed. 

We are looking for a highly-experienced senior executive, who has advised donors, and who has proven success in stewarding collaborations and closing major gifts. You have raised millions of dollars without a large team, and you have insight into donor's-mindset, and even have been a grantmaker. You can spark and steward relationships that are more than transactional. 

Many teens at Hack Club take traditional paths, and we definitely believe there may be diverse candidates for this role who have a non-traditional fundraising background. (The COO was formerly a war journalist. The founder dropped out of high school.) If you believe you'd be great at this role, apply and let us know why! We are open to candidates at an earlier stage in their career who would fill a role closer to that of an astute deputy to assist the COO in the fundraising (salary will be commensurate with experience).

**Responsibilities include:**

First and foremost, your goal is to raise $5-$7 million a year in 2022, in partnership with the COO. 

**Fundraising**
- Tee up the COO/CEO to close on major gifts
- Research foundations, craft proposals, initiate new relationships
- Manage and prioritize leadership's time fundraising
- Prepare presentation materials
- Engage in personal networking and leverage the capacity of other team members, and the board to make contacts and engage, secure, and retain donors

**Strategy and planning**
- Devise with leadership a donor brand and keep us focused
- Build Hack Club's donor management system-- simple at first, and we can grow it
- Review call transcripts and craft strategies
- Manage touchpoints for existing donors 

**Communications**
- Strong writing skills- you'll be crafting a lot of personal emails or drafting for the founder
- Occasionally contact media and coordinate event coverage
- Conceptualize and plan dinners/parties/1:1s 
  
  
  **GOAL**: The right candidate will successfully know that they and the COO can raise $5-$7 million in 2022.  
  
Lastly, our philosophy: By teenagers, for teenagers. 

Hack Clubbers build a large part of Hack Club, and all our donor materials, and our donations, are kept publicly in our GitHub and totally-transparent financial ledger. This transparency inspired Elon Musk to tweet that Hack Club was a "cool group" (and give a major gift!)
