[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports high school coders in starting coding clubs, hackathons, and building awesome projects. Founded in 2014, Hack Club's mission is to support, inspire and motivate teenagers from all backgrounds to become highly technical, and use their computer skills to solve problems.

Hack Club is a fun, quickly-growing start-up, run by a small team of highly-creative engineers, building programs every day for thousands of teenagers from around the world.
