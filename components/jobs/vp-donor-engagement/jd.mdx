Interested in a dynamic, quickly-growing entrepreneurial nonprofit with teens and technology at its core? Hack Club supports high school coders in 36 states and 22 countries in starting coding clubs, hackathons, and building awesome projects.

As **VP, Donor Engagement** (a new position), you'll shape and advance our philanthropy strategy, and lead on executing it alongside Hack Club's COO, its board, and a team of designers, video, and social media contractors. You'll be working closely with an incredibly talented and unusual creative team of engineers, international journalists, billionaire coders, and teen hackers!
