**VP of Marketing / Executive Producer, Hack Club Communications**

[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, founded by a 16-year-old high school dropout and run by engineers, many of them teenagers. Our mission is to be a home for technical teenagers to build and code with their friends, and—when successful—foster a new generation of highly technical young people who have skills to solve our greatest problems.

Much like the Boy and Girl Scouts a century ago, Hack Club is a cultural institution for young people. However, it's built post-internet by teenagers and is already backed by some of the 21st century's most prominent builders, including Elon Musk, and many more.

Hack Club is actively **looking now to hire its first VP of Marketing / Executive Producer** to tell its story across various platforms, including social media, newsletters, op-docs, blog/Op-Ed posts, direct emails, and curated partnerships with major tech companies.

One unique and fun aspect of working for Hack Club is that you interact directly with teenagers every day—half our team is under 18. Also, Hack Club is engineer-led, so the work is always new and focused around cool new projects teenagers code.

Your goal is to tell Hack Club's story so that every technical teenager in the world hears about Hack Club and in a way that makes Hack Club better for those already in it.

In this role, you'd manage a squad of highly technical teenagers and a group of contractors (video/design). You'd report to the COO, who is a former journalist and has been leading our comms among other duties. She has produced a TIME Magazine cover, a NYT op-doc, landed the front page of Hacker News, created viral tweets/YouTube videos, and personally written hundreds of articles for all the major mainstream media outlets.

**Responsibilities for you and your team include:**

- Generating blog posts geared towards Hack Clubbers, pulling from our engineers' projects, the founder, and teen hackers; and then repurposing those posts across various platforms
- Pitching partnerships with technical YouTubers, and managing them
- Producing videos about teen-led projects, [like this](https://youtu.be/PCM_-c_j98Y)
- Producing op-docs [like this](https://hack.af/zephyrdoc)
- Going through all our [AMAs](https://hackclub.com/amas) and creating a single 6-minute compilation of them
- Creating a 2-minute launch video for Clubs at Hack Club
- Successfully facilitating teenagers to lead on projects
- Curating and managing 30-60-90 day content calendar
- Oversee the production of informative and interesting weekly newsletters for Hack Clubbers and donors
- Working closely with the COO to optimize the content calendar across all platforms to coincide with new marketing and product launches

You'd have a budget, plus 2-3 teenagers working for you, both full and part-time, remote and in person.

Hack Club is already the largest network of technical teenagers in the world, with thousands from the US and 28 countries. Built by teenagers, for teenagers, Hack Club has many teenagers with incredible stories to tell, as well as an opinionated attitude about education/economy/childhood/the internet in the 21st century. We've already been featured in [Wall Street Journal](https://hack.af/wsj), CBS News, other newspapers, plus we have a decent Twitter/YouTube/GitHub following without any dedicated effort. Hack Club is engineer-led, and our audience is technical.

**Requirements:**

Hack Club's work is highly technical. Our content must go deep in capturing technical ideas.

- You know what GitHub is.
- You've created content that's gone viral.
- You have experience with design software.
- You haven't done the above, but you've worked in media and can prove you're a super fast learner whose jumped into new areas before.
- Demonstrated ability to repurpose long form content (blogs/Op-Eds/conversation transcriptions) into into micro-content (short videos or static posts, stories, memes).
- You're comfortable communicating online (we're on Slack).
- You can run a small team, and you can manage a project.
- You're over 18, or you're really an amazing 16+. No age limit.

**More About Hack Club:**

The mission of Hack Club is to be a place where teenagers can become more technical, feel welcome in getting started, and feel inspired to build with code in ways that are always honest, transparent, high-integrity, kind, and friendly. We want teenagers to self-organize and assert themselves as persons.

Already, Hack Club is the **largest network of teen coders in the country**. We hope for a world where Hack Club becomes a nationwide cultural institution, creating a new generation of young people with the skills, network, and value system to become problem-solvers and builders for the 21st century—a new Girl and Boy Scouts.
