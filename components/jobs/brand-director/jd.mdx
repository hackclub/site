Hi, I'm Christina, Hack Club COO, and I'm looking to hire a Brand Director to lead our team of journalists, programmers, startup entrepreneurs and donors in telling Hack Club's story.

As Brand Director, you'll mastermind and execute a strategy to present Hack Club beautifully---with sophistication, nuance and edge---to our donor audience, who include the world’s most innovative, creative, disruptive and wealthy individuals.

The mission of **[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)** is to be a place where teenagers can become more technical, feel welcome in getting started, feel inspired to build with code in ways that are always honest, transparent, high-integrity, kind and friendly. We want students to self-organize and assert themselves as persons.

Already, Hack Club is the largest network of talented teen coders in the country. When successful, Hack Club will be a nationwide cultural institution, creating a new generation of young people with the skills, network, and value system to become problem-solvers and builders for the 21st century-- a new Boy and Girl Scouts.

You should have experience building a brand from scratch in the nonprofit sector for a donor audience.

You will be Hack Club's first brand director, so although we have ideas we are looking for someone who listens well, and then drives this process.

Activities could include creating a library of video assets, creating donor materials, designing outreach campaigns, hosting events on Clubhouse or in our AMAs, orchestrating a series of journalism pieces, and working alongside our 9-person team of coders, engineers and artists; as well as hiring contractors to implement the vision.

We'll be working closely together, and my background is as a print, magazine, radio journalist and editor and doc-maker, published in news outlets like The New York Times, The Atlantic and The Economist.

Join me if you’re excited about taking a startup to its next stage, and launching an idea that will change the world alongside a creative, adventurous and spirited team working in a fast-paced environment.

**Hack Club** is a fun, small, creative, tight-knit team that does a lot of creative, in-person work. We have a strong preference is for someone in-person in Burlington, VT, but we will consider applications from people who want to work remotely, provided they be willing to travel to our offices. We have COVID protocols and take them seriously. Relocation assistance available.

To apply, please email us at <brand.director@hackclub.com> with "hack the planet" in the subject line. We don't think we'll be able to identify this person by looking at resume alone, so please include 300-400 words on your background relative to this role and why you're interested.

Compensation range: $120K - $140k, depending on experience and fit. We offer healthcare and 4 weeks paid vacation.

\- Christina Asquith, COO, and Zach Latta, Executive Director

Founded in 2014 by a teen hacker on the internet, 500 Hack Club are running today in high schools across the US and world. Nearly 12,000 students across the US and in 22 other countries have joined our online community, the most popular network of technically talented teenagers in the world. Since 2016, Hack Club has raised $2.8 million, and appeared in The Wall Street Journal, California Sunday Magazine, and The Today Show. Since COVID shut down schools, and Elon Musk tweeted Hack Club was "a cool group", our online community grown 700 percent.

Hack Club staff works directly with 14-18 year olds, as they run their own clubs and build amazing projects, including a weather balloon that sent an Arduino into space, a summer project that distributed $50k in hardware, a program to send thousands of hand-written cards to front-line COVID workers, a robot from recyled parts in Zambia, and so much more.

Hack Club operates with zero cost to school systems or taxpayers; has no teachers or curriculum; is remote and online; and is totally free and accessible to all teenagers regardless of race, gender or economic background. Our model works in rich, poor, urban and remote schools. Hack Club is also fully transparent with its finances, and operates at one of the lowest costs per student in the nonprofit sector. We rarely do corporate partnerships.

We pride ourselves in being a coding education nonprofit that acts more like a tech-start up. Our work environment is fun, challenging, risk-taking, and high-energy. We are structured, but support flexible hours.
