  This is not a normal job. For the last 18 months, a small team has produced a series of online events, and we're excited to hire an incredible, technical person to carry forward and build on these ideas. You'd be our 9th or so full-time staff member. 

  In the Hack Club Slack, you'll work with our community to create the best and most inclusive place on the internet for technical teenagers. To work at Hack Club, you need to have a background in programming, but **you should be inspired by making things fun.**

  We are actively looking for candidates who have worked successfully with girl hackers before. We invite and encourage all interested candidates to apply even if they don't feel they meet all of the criteria.

  **How to apply:** Email <jobs@hackclub.com> with "golden" in the subject line, 3 bullet points demonstrating why you would be exceptional for the role, and your resume.

  This role pays between $60K - $100K, depending on your experience&mdash; and we know that's probably less than you'd make elsewhere. We offer healthcare and 4 weeks paid vacation.
