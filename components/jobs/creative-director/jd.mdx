**Starting salary:** $108K - $120k  
**Location:** Burlington, Vermont or remote

Hi, I'm Christina, Hack Club COO, and I'm looking to hire an experienced, creative individual to lead our team of journalists, programmers, startup entrepreneurs and donors in telling Hack Club's story. We're calling this position Creative Director, and looking for someone with journalism, marketing, design, leadership and storytelling skills. 

As Creative Director, you'll mastermind and execute a strategy to present Hack Club beautifully---with sophistication, nuance and edge---to our donor audience, who include the world’s most innovative, creative, disruptive and wealthy individuals.

The mission of **[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)** is to be a place where teenagers can become more technical, feel welcome in getting started, feel inspired to build with code in ways that are always honest, transparent, high-integrity, kind and friendly. We want students to self-organize and assert themselves as persons.

When successful, Hack Club will be a nationwide cultural institution, creating a new generation of young people with the skills, network, and value system to become problem-solvers and builders for the 21st century. 100 years ago, the Boy and Girl Scouts emerged and guided young people with values and skills and an identity as the economy transitioned from agriculture to industry. We see Hack Club as a modern Boy and Girl Scouts, and we need you to help us tell our story as we become a nationwide organization and a new teen identity.  

We'll be working together in this effort. I founded and led [The Fuller Project](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/women-foreign-correspondents/472596/) for nearly a decade, and sparked an awareness amongst newsroom leaders of stories about women and girls around the world, particularly in war. I led fundraising for the first $7 million; and have 20 years of journalism experience reporting for news outlets like The New York Times, The Atlantic and The Economist.

Join me if you’re excited about taking a startup to its next stage, and launching an idea that will change the world alongside a creative, adventurous and spirited team working in a fast-paced environment.

**Your Week at Hack Club:**

- Produce and run amazing student-hosted AMAs every month, and mini AMA workshops weekly, with guests that have previously included Elon Musk, Stripe's Patrick Collison, Facebook's Chris Cox, and SpaceX's Gwynne Shotwell. Done well, our online events will be smart, unpredictable, funny and totally different.

- Brainstorm with the founder and COO about education, technology and nonprofits.

- Design (or hire a designer) to build our storytelling tools, including a deck, a long proposal and a short proposal. You'll be teamed up with the founder and COO to execute on creating content that really reflects our values and ideas, and you'll need to do the rigorous reporting / journalism to get it right

- Tell Hack Clubber student stories. Hack Club uncovers hidden Einsteins, and their work can inspire you. We want those projects shared in video, articles, websites and Twitter threads. Do you have a killer news instinct that you can train onto our community, and break stories, and connect that to bigger news events?

**About You:**

- You have stellar 21st century journalism skills, meaning you can write, report, do basic video editing, tweet, post, make graphs, write a succinct email and will learn basic design software

- You’ve worked in journalism, communications, marketing or philanthropy, or can demonstrate top-quality work via projects/articles/reports

- You can demonstrate a creative/weird/fearless side

- You can leave a brainstorm meeting, do some reporting, and come back with a first draft and ideas where to place it

- You have good executive functioning and organizational skills to manage up the founder and COO

- You are a stickler for grammar and clean copy. Fact checking matters to you

- You really like working with high schoolers

- You embody the values of a model Hack Clubber: collaborative, kind, high integrity, helpful, and curious

- You have the traits of a wonderful mentor: never condescending, never telling students how to do things, answer questions, but don't lock students into any one specific course of action, genuinely want to see students learn and figure out things on their own

Since 2016, Hack Club has raised $2.8 million, and appeared in The Wall Street Journal, California Sunday Magazine, and The Today Show.

Hack Club staff works directly with 14-18 year olds, as they run their own clubs and build amazing projects, including a weather balloon that sent an Arduino into space, a summer project that distributed $50k in hardware, a program to send thousands of hand-written cards to front-line COVID workers, a robot from recyled parts in Zambia, and so much more.

Hack Club operates with zero cost to school systems or taxpayers; has no teachers or curriculum; is remote and online; and is totally free and accessible to all teenagers regardless of race, gender or economic background. Our model works in rich, poor, urban and remote schools. Hack Club is also fully transparent with its finances, and operates at one of the lowest costs per student in the nonprofit sector.
