The mission of **[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)** is to be a place where teenagers can become more technical, feel welcome in getting started, feel inspired to build with code in ways that are always honest, transparent, high-integrity, kind and friendly. We want students to self-organize and assert themselves as persons.

When successful, Hack Club will be a nationwide cultural institution, creating a new generation of young people become problem-solvers and builders for the 21st century, similar to the Boy and Girl Scouts of a century earlier.

But who shaped the story of the Boy and Girl Scouts?

We're hiring our first Creative Director to work alongside our mix of journalists, programmers, startup entrepreneurs and donors, who include the world’s most innovative and creative individuals, to create a movement of young people who self-identify as “hackers”. As Creative Director, you'll mastermind and execute our goal to widely publicize the transformative ideas driving Hack Club.

You’ll be reporting to Hack Club COO, Christina Asquith, who founded and led [The Fuller Project](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/women-foreign-correspondents/472596/) for nearly a decade, and inspired newsroom leaders to take seriously journalism on women, particularly in war. She led fundraising for the first $7 million; and has 20 years of journalism experience reporting for news outlets like The New York Times, The Atlantic and The Economist.

Together with the founder and COO, you will drive the creation of Hack Club's storytelling, leading in publishing op-eds, essays, blogs and think pieces;  producing our live AMA events (like our [AMA with Elon Musk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riru9OzScwk)), and crafting of creative ways to directly communicate Hack Club’s ideas to CEOs and leaders who support our movement. Join us if you’re excited about taking a startup to its next stage, launching an idea that will change the world alongside a creative, adventurous and spirited team working in a fast-paced environment.

**About Hack Club, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, global organization:**

Founded in 2014 by a teen hacker on the internet, 500 Hack Club are running today in high schools across the US and world. Nearly 12,000 students across the US and in 22 other countries have joined our online community, the most popular network of technically talented teenagers in the world. Since 2016, Hack Club has raised $2.8 million, and appeared in The Wall Street Journal, California Sunday Magazine, and The Today Show. Since COVID shut down schools, and Elon Musk tweeted Hack Club was "a cool group", our online community skyrocketed 700 percent.

Hack Club is 4 parts: student-run, after-school computer science clubs; an online 24-hour technical chat community; a financial system for teenagers; and in-person/online computer science events.

Hack Club staff works directly with 14-18 year olds, as they run their own clubs and build amazing projects, including a weather balloon that sent an Arduino into space, a summer project that distributed $50k in hardware, a program to send thousands of hand-written cards to front-line COVID workers, a robot from recyled parts in Zambia, and so much more.

Hack Club operates with zero cost to school systems or taxpayers; has no teachers or curriculum; is remote and online; and is totally free and accessible to all teenagers regardless of race, gender or economic background. Our model works in rich, poor, urban and remote schools. Hack Club is also fully transparent with its finances, and operates at one of the lowest costs per student in the nonprofit sector. We rarely do corporate partnerships.

Hack Club is building a powerful base of philanthropic donors to help us achieve our mission of supporting teenagers to launch a Hack Club in every high school in every state across the US, sparking a new generation of inspired young builders, to lead America with 21st century technical skills.

Your job is to help us tell Hack Club's story. We pride ourselves in being a coding education nonprofit that acts more like a tech-start up. Our work environment is fun, challenging, risk-taking, and high-energy. We are structured, but support flexible hours.
