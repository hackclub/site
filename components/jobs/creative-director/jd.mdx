[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) is changing the way teenagers learn to build and innovate with code, and aims to be a nationwide cultural institution helping young people have agency to become kind, curious problem-solvers and builders, similar to the Girl and Boy Scouts of a century earlier.

We're looking for a Creative Director to work alongside our mix of journalists, programmers, startup entrepreneurs and donors, who include the world’s most innovative and creative individuals, to create a movement of young people who self-identify as “hackers”.

You’ll be reporting to Hack Club COO, Christina Asquith, who is founder and former editor-in-chief of [The Fuller Project](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/women-foreign-correspondents/472596/), a women’s rights journalism organization, where she raised $7 million; and has 20 years of experience reporting for news outlets like The New York Times, The Atlantic and others.

Together, you will publish media, produce live events (like our [AMA with Elon Musk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riru9OzScwk)), and craft creative ways to directly communicate Hack Club’s ideas to CEOs and leaders who support our movement. Join us if you’re excited about taking a startup to its next stage, launching an idea that will change the world alongside a creative, adventurous and spirited team working in a fast-paced environment.

Couple of ways your day will be filled:

- Produce and run amazing student-hosted AMAs every month, and mini AMA workshops weekly, with guests that have previously included Elon Musk, Stripe's Patrick Collison, Facebook's Chris Cox, and SpaceX's Gwynne Shotwell. Done well, our online events will be smart, unpredictable, funny and totally different.

- Design (or hire a designer) to build our storytelling tools, including a deck, a long proposal and a short proposal. You'll be teamed up with the founder and COO to execute on creating content that really reflects our values and ideas, and you'll need to do the rigorous reporting/journalism to get it right

- Tell Hack Clubber student stories. Hack Club uncovers hidden Einsteins, and their work can inspire you. We want those projects shared in video, articles, websites and Twitter threads. Do you have a killer news instinct that you can train onto our community, and break stories, and connect that to bigger news events?

- Partner with the COO, who works across the organization on strategy, communications, fundraising, networking and storytelling. Be excited to build Hack Club, and take on the huge range of tasks that are needed in a startup.

About you:

- You embody the values of a model Hack Clubber: collaborative, kind, high integrity, helpful, and curious

- You have stellar 21st century storytelling skills, meaning you can write, report, do basic video editing, tweet, post, make graphs, write a succinct email and will learn basic design software

- You’ve worked in journalism, communications or philanthropy

- You might be a former newsroom editor, or a founder of a failed startup or launched the comms team of a design company or worked in philanthropy

- You can demonstrate a creative/weird/fearless side

- Great executive functioning and organizational skills to manage up the founder and COO

- You are a stickler for grammar and clean copy. Fact checking matters to you

- You really like working with high schoolers

- You have the traits of a wonderful mentor: never condescending, never telling students how to do things, answer questions, but don't lock students into any one specific course of action, genuinely want to see students learn and figure out things on their own

- You founded something. At some point. Maybe it blew up, but you understand how to take initiative

Strong preference is for someone in-person in Burlington, VT, but we will consider applications from people who want to work remotely, provided they be willing to travel to our offices - we have COVID protocols and take them seriously. Relocation assistance available.

To apply, please email us at creative.director@hackclub.com with "hack the planet" in the subject line. We don't think we'll be able to identify this person by looking at resume alone, so please include 300-400 words on your background relative to this role and why you're interested.

Compensation range: $108K - $120k, depending on experience and fit. We offer healthcare and 4 weeks paid vacation.
