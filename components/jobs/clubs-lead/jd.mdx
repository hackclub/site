At Hack Club (https://hackclub.com), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, we're building a giant video game, but instead of being made out of bits and code, it's made out of teenagers. And instead of pushing players to get a high score, Hack Club helps teenagers learn to code, build the most meaningful friendships of their lives, and develop strong identities to become the future leaders our world needs.

Elon Musk spoke with Hack Clubbers last year and said [Hack Club "makes me feel much more optimistic about the future"](https://hackclub.com/elon/).

Alongside the soccer players, theater kids, and band geeks, we aspire to create and foster a new type of high schooler: the teenage hacker. Our goal: to become as ubiquitous, as universal, and as culturally foundational for young people today as the Girl and Boy Scouts were 70 years ago.

**Title:** Clubs Lead

**Job Description:**

As our 8th full-time staff member, you'd be taking the reins of the central pillar of Hack Club: our Clubs Program, and lead it into becoming a special and deeply cherished experience in the life of every teenager who goes through it.

Every year, thousands of teenagers aged 14-18 across America find themselves in the same position in high school: they discovered a love of coding, want to spread their love of it through a community at their high school, but struggle when starting a coding club. That's where Hack Club comes in and why they decide to start Hack Clubs instead.

As the head of the Clubs Program, you will be responsible for helping hundreds of Hack Club leaders around the world run the best coding clubs. A formal list of your responsibilities would be something like:

- End-to-end owning onboarding new Hack Club leaders, from designing and maintaining the application flow, to reviewing and making decisions on new applications, to running onboarding video calls, to providing Hack Club leaders with the resources they need to get started (and building a team to do the same)

- Building strong personal relationships with new leaders, and working closely with them to make sure they're getting the support they need.

- Identifying the areas in which club leaders are struggling and building systems that support them in those areas.

- Leading and hack together the push for new content, including new [workshops](https://workshops.hackclub.com/), [Meetings](https://meetings.hackclub.com/), and other support materials.

A bit of what we suspect you'll be like:

- You know how to code. When you were a teenager, you were curious about how things worked and enjoyed tinkering with computers.

- As a teenager, you were part of an online community or ran something like a Hack Club. You could have founded a school club, roleplayed in Neopets, ran a trend-setting Tumblr, grown up on the Minecraft modding forums, created fanfiction on AO3, sold Runescape bots, helped run a summer camp, ran a Club Penguin blog, been an artist on DeviantArt, been a moderator in an online MMO, created a YouTube channel when you were 12, helped grow an IRC network, or anything else along the same vein. (but even if you don't think you hit these, please apply anyway!)

- You have the traits of a wonderful friend: always encouraging, genuinely want to see teenagers learn and figure out things on their own, excited to answer questions, and always wanting to help people find their own course of action

- You embody the values of a model Hack Clubber: collaborative, kind, high integrity, helpful, and curious

- You want to build and scale a beautiful, magical, and deeply impactful experience for teenagers

- You're excited to work 1:1 with high school students every day

**Location:** We have an in-person office in Burlington, Vermont where six of us work collaboratively. This is an in-person role, though this position can temporarily start remotely during COVID. Relocation assistance is provided.

To apply, email <jobs@hackclub.com> with "magic" in the subject line. We don't think we'll be able to identify you just by looking at your resume, so please include 300-400 words on your background relative to this role and why you're interested.

And last, some details on compensation. This role pays between $60 - $100K, depending on your experience---and as a nonprofit we know that's probably less than you'd make elsewhere. We offer healthcare and 4 weeks paid vacation.
