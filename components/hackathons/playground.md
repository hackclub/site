## Coding is a superpower

## Start building

The best way to learn is by building. A hackathon is a space that helps give makers everything they need to start building– mentors, collaborators, inspiration, and a goal to work towards. Hackers will leave a good hackathon with a project of their own built. They'll leave a great hackathon ready and excited to build other projects once they get home.

## Burn twice as bright

Immediacy and Impermanence

## Learn to build, build to learn

## Sandbox

Some challenges are hard to solve. 

## More friends, more fun

Hack Club is a world wide community of thousands of high school makers. We're organizers, coders, hackers, painters, engineers, musicians, writers, volunteers. We make things. We want others to make things too.

Why should hackathons exist?

Hackathons are a place for people who build things to meet up with others who do the same.

The setting is a space to make things because that's a common thread. Many are working on their own projects seperately– that's ok too. The important part is being in a room of people building things while also building things yourself.

What are the tennants of philosophy? (summary of hackclub.com/philosophy)

- coding is a superpower / consumer -> creator
- great equalizer
- build in school b/c school doesn't provide that
- carpentry without wood
- community

What are the tennants of hackathons? (proposed structure of hackclub.com/hackathons)

approach #1:
- ~~it's what you know and who you know– learning to code is great, but this puts you in touch with all the other builders~~
- it's said that you're a combination of your 5 closest friends– at a hackathon your 5 closest friends are all constructive
- *building is better with friends*
- social barrier to learning
  - how can so few code when a google search for "learn to code" yields so many results? there's a motivation issue

approach #2:
- democratizes learning– don't wait for knowledge to be handed down, go out and seek it
- *at a hackathon, you're building towards a positive "shipping something new that you created"*
    - carrot, not stick
- *the first step to building something great is "building something"*
  - 24 hours is probably too short for you to change the world, but is the perfect size for building
- creates friend groups
  - so many of our friends are determined by shared setting– same age group, same suburb
  - *chance to create a friend group tied together not by setting but by interest*

approach #2b:
- building is better with friends
<!-- - holy craft / for the love of craft -->
- more friends, more fun
  - many friend groups spring up around shared setting– growing up in the same town or age group
  - hackathons are a chance to create a friend group tied together not by setting but by interest– a shared love of craft.
- don't save the world
  <!-- - the first step to "doing good" is just "doing" -->
  - the first step to building something great is "building something"
  - 24 hours is probably too short for you to change the world, but is a great length for learning a new skill or tool

- friends
  - coding doesn't have to be an isolating experience
  - realize you aren't alone
  - make friends based on shared interest instead of shared setting
- walking away having done something (physical output)
  - your project
  - your confidence
- picked up a random skill through pure necessity
- creative energy
  - programming can be an art– just go out and noodle with others playing that jazz
- gives a future goal
  - once you go to a hackathon you can go to more

quotes / flavor: (just brainstorming– not all of these will fit a section)
- *oh the places you'll go*
- oh the people you'll know
- *mo' friends, mo' fun*
- let's play a game
- build for yourself
- *build for yourself, together*
- hack, hack, hack
- a shared interest
- a shared purpose
- *the first step to building something great is "building something"*
- *a world of pure imagination*
- the adventure continues
