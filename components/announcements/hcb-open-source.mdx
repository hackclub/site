Hack Club launched HCB in 2018 to enable hackathons to raise and spend money
through [fiscal sponsorship](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/). Since
then, we’ve expanded to all nonprofit projects; our 12,000 users have transacted
$50 million.

Local student-ran hackathons, robotics teams, and community groups use HCB as a
nonprofit neobank to collect donations, send payments, issue debit cards, and
gain 501(c)(3) status.

When we started HCB, it was developed in private for security reasons. That
said, one of Hack Club’s core principles has always been transparency - we [open
source](https://github.com/hackclub/ledger) our
[finances](https://hcb.hackclub.com/hq), [document how we run
events](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble), and have 500+ public repositories
on [GitHub](https://github.com/hackclub).

***[github.com/hackclub/hcb](https://github.com/hackclub/hcb) is now public -
check it out and star it.***

Paired with our technical documentation, it’s a great resource for anyone
interested in building financial software or applications with Ruby on Rails.
Our engineering work is also entirely public; the world can learn from our
successes and mistakes.

Since 2018, over fifty people have made 10k+ commits to HCB (thank you!); we
can’t wait for more contributors to join us:
