Hack Club launched HCB in 2018 to enable hackathons to raise and spend money through [fiscal sponsorship](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/). Since then, we’ve expanded to all nonprofit projects; our 12,000 users have transacted $50 million.

When we started HCB, it was developed in private for security reasons. That said, one of Hack Club’s core principles has always been transparency - we [open source our finances](https://github.com/hackclub/ledger), [document how we run events](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble), and have 500+ public repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/hackclub).

***[github.com/hackclub/hcb](https://github.com/hackclub/hcb) is now public - check it out and star it.***

Paired with our technical documentation, it’s a great resource for anyone interested in building financial software or applications with Ruby on Rails. Our engineering work is also entirely public; the world can learn from our successes and mistakes.

Since 2018, over fifty people have made 10k+ commits to HCB (thank you!); we can’t wait for more contributors to join us:
