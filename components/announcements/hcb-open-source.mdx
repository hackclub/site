In 2018, Hack Club launched HCB, a financial toolkit for students to fundraise and organize hackathons. **Over the years, it’s grown into so much more:**

We’ve expanded past events, and now over 5,000 organizations use HCB to manage their finances & drive positive change in the world.

When we started HCB, it was being developed in private. Over time, we’ve being welcoming more Hack Clubbers onto the codebase. Last spring, we mentored six Hack Clubber one-on-one as part of “Mentorship”. That helped us prepare the repository for new contributors. 

**And, now, we’re ready to make the repository public!** Check it out: [github.com/hackclub/hcb](http://github.com/hackclub/hcb).

In the same way that [open sourcing our finances](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/nonprofits-need-to-embrace-transparency-even-if-the-supreme-court-rules-to-protect-donor-privacy) has helped others run events, we hope that that open sourcing our codebase will help others looking to run production-ready neobanks.

At the same time, this is an opportunity for every HCB user to contribute towards making HCB a better platform. We’ve set up a guide to getting started with HCB, and [we’re always happy to help](mailto:hcb-engr@hackclub.com).

HCB has an exciting future ahead of it - we can’t wait to work with you to continue making it the best platform to run a nonprofit!
