Elon Musk holds a special place amongst hackers. After growing up in a difficult
family situation in South Africa, working his way in small jobs until reaching
Los Angeles, teaching himself to code, and making hundreds of millions
co-founding PayPal, he has kept on building. He’s pioneered electric cars,
reusable rockets, renewable energy storage, and many other important
initiatives.

For all those reasons, it was a huge honor last month to have him
[spend an hour in a Hack Club AMA](https://youtu.be/riru9OzScwk)—at one point he
remarked we were “asking better questions than all the mainstream media.” After
further discussion, he wanted to support us further.

# Today, we announce: Elon Musk has donated $500k to Hack Club!

This generous gift from Elon is remarkable in so many ways. Elon supports Hack
Club because we are a community of builders, and because we recognize that our
school system lacks in so many ways & is overdue for a disruption. We’re one of
very few nonprofits Elon supports.

Over the coming months, we’ll share much more about how we’ll be growing &
improving Hack Club.

Hack Club’s mission is to build a new generation of hackers. This starts in high
school, where Hack Club students learn to be technically proficient, build their
friend network, learn to raise and spend money, and develop into kind, curious,
thoughtful, optimistic and honest leaders.

Elon Musk is now supporting you & your work—so go out & do amazing things. Elon
can’t wait to see what you make.
