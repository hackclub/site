Elon Musk holds a special place amongst hackers. After growing up in a
difficult family situation in South Africa, working his way in small jobs until
reaching Los Angeles, teaching himself to code, and making hundreds of millions
co-founding PayPal, he kept on building.

From bringing America back to space to pioneering electric cars, there are few
better examples of hackers being the change they hope to see in the world.

It was a huge honor last month to have Elon [spend an hour in a Hack Club
AMA](https://youtu.be/riru9OzScwk)—at one point he remarked we were “asking
better questions than all the mainstream media.” After further discussion, Elon
wanted to support Hack Club further.

# Today, I'm proud to share that Elon Musk is donating $500,000 to Hack Club.

In so many ways, this is a milestone for Hack Club and for every student who
calls themselves a Hack Clubber. Elon is supporting us because we are a
commmunity of builders. When we see problems in the world, we don't try to
blame someone else: we try to take them on ourselves to solve.  We're one of
the very few nonprofits Elon supports.

Over the coming months, we'll share more about what Elon's support is going to
mean for Hack Club. We have a lot of important thinking to do. Internally,
we're talking about open sourcing HQ's finances, hiring new staff to better
support Hack Clubbers, and putting together some sort of summer program—but
frankly there is much more deep thought to do.

Hack Club’s mission is to build a new generation of hackers. This starts in
high school, where Hack Club students learn to be technically proficient, build
their friend network, learn to raise and spend money, and develop into kind,
curious, thoughtful, optimistic, and honest leaders.

Elon Musk is now supporting you and your work, so go out and do amazing things.
Elon can’t wait to see what you make.
