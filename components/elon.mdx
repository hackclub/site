_A letter from [Hack Club's](https://hackclub.com) founder, Zach Latta._

# Today, I'm proud to share that Elon Musk is donating \$500,000 to Hack Club.

Elon Musk is one of the most prolific & ambitious hackers of the last decade.

It was a huge honor last month to have Elon [spend an hour in an ask-me-anything call with our community of high schoolers](https://youtu.be/riru9OzScwk)---at one point he remarked we were "asking better questions than all the mainstream media" and called us "very wholesome".

**Afterwards, Elon wanted to support Hack Club further by donating \$500,000.**

In so many ways, this is a milestone for every Hack Clubber. 6 years ago, I started Hack Club as a 16-year-old programmer, and grew Hack Club into what it is today: an active community of 500 student-led clubs around the world and... Now Elon Musk is one of our largest supporters.

Elon is supporting us because we are a community of builders. When hackers see problems in the world, we don't blame someone else: we try to take them on ourselves to solve. Elon is very selective about the nonprofits he supports and I'm proud Hack Club is one of them.

So... how is Hack Club going to invest \$500,000? We want to use this to help 1,000 more students start and join Hack Clubs in their towns. For those already in Hack Club, we look to you to help us make a more high-quality experience. We plan to do a lot of what we have already been doing (and [what I wrote about at the beginning of the year](https://zachinto2020.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/as-midnight-approaches/)): we'll spend as little money as possible at all times, and we'll grow slowly, adding diverse staff from video game designers, software engineers and media producers to make Hack Club better. We are pushing hard now to expand [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank/), and continuing to try and make the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/) the best place to be a teenager on the internet.

We'll be fully transparent in how we spend this money. One thing we've been doing since winning the [Frank Grant](https://grant.frank.ly/) and now with Elon's donation, is open sourcing our finances. Hack Club HQ has been running on Hack Club Bank since February and starting today, you can see our finances publicly at <https://bank.hackclub.com/hq>. You can track how we spend every single dollar of Elon's gift. Soon, we will also launch [Frank's](https://frank.ly/) transparency tools on <https://hackclub.com>.

Hack Club's mission is to build a new generation of hackers. This starts in high school, where Hack Club students learn to be technically proficient, build their friend network, learn to raise and spend money, and develop into kind, curious, thoughtful, optimistic, and honest leaders.

To every Hack Clubber: Elon Musk is now supporting you and your work, so go forth and do amazing things. We can't wait to show Elon what you make.

â€”Zach
