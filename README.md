Join us in building Hack Club's homepage and show new hackers what Hack Club could be for them ðŸ’–.

See something that could be better? Make a PR! Have an easter egg idea? Make a PR! Is the site missing something? Make a PR! _(Do you see a trend? :))_

If you need to add content to the site, here's how you can:

<details> <summary>Create a new card</summary>
<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-16 at 9 09 55 PM" src="https://github.com/hackclub/site/assets/65808924/fed45800-c834-4e4c-ad87-a21e01414fa9">

Most things on the homepage are cards, modular components that can easily be added and removed according to relevancy to Hack Clubbers. There are 3 main sections: connection, open-source, and IRL community. Most new cards will likely fall within the first two sections!

First, you can create a new file under [components/index/cards]() with the name of your new event/project. Next add `import CardModel from './card-model'` and add whatever you want :) Finally, use a <Buttons> component (`import Buttons from './button'`) to highlight call-to-action buttons. If it's the main button, use the primary prop to add a background color!

Your challenge: try and make the card as unique as possible, like a mini poster! Not sure where to start? Look at other cards on the page :)

<details>
<summary>Add to the carousel</summary>

<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-16 at 9 09 11 PM" src="https://github.com/hackclub/site/assets/65808924/044660eb-fb3d-43b6-a270-64a3fe51f3ca">

If there's a Hack Club or Hack Club community-led project (past or present) that Hack Clubbers can get involved in, please add it to [lib/carousel.json]() and add your card to the end of the json file. An example looks like this:

```
{
    "background": "dark",
    "titleColor": "white",
    "descriptionColor": "white",
    "title": "Hackers Wanted",
    "description": "Our open love letter to hackers",
    "img": "https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-large/1f4bb@2x.png",
    "link": "/hackers-wanted"
  }
```

</details>

Every week, [thousands of people](https://plausible.io/hackclub.com) visit hackclub.com. What story to you want to tell?
